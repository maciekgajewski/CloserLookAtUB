# Closer look at undefined behaviour and compiler optimizations

## Abstract

In this talk we'll explore few interesting instances of undefined behaviour and compiler optimizations working together.
We all know that invoking UB can, theoretically, result in your hard-drive being formatted. But what actually happens? What will the compiler do?

## About

This talk was prepared for C++ Meetup in Amsterda, April 2018.
It is a development of my previous talk on UB, which I presented at meet-up in Rotterdam, 26-01-2018 (https://maciekgajewski.github.io/QuickButCloseLookAtUB/index.html#/)
